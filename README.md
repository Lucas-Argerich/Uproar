# Uproar

Uproar is a social media app built with React and Firestore. Users can create an account, log in, and post messages to a public feed. They can also view other users' profiles, follow and unfollow other users, and like and comment on posts.

The app uses Firestore to store user accounts and posts and to keep track of likes and comments. It also uses React Router to navigate between different pages, and Redux to manage the application states.

Uproar is designed to be responsive and accessible, with a modern user interface that makes it easy to use on both desktop and mobile devices. The app is written in TypeScript, which helps catch errors early in the development process and makes it easier to refactor code.

Overall, Uproar provides a fun and engaging platform for users to connect with each other and share their thoughts and ideas.
